You may be wondering why some contributions are missing from your profile. There are a few common gotchas you should be aware of when it comes to repositories that opendor.me may index.

First, only repositories owned by registered users or organizations a registered user is a public member of may be indexed. Feel free to spread the word so we may reach more of the community!

Second, if you are part of an organization, make sure you are a public member. By default, GitHub sets organization members to private members and we won't be able to see that you are associated with that organization.

Finally, make sure your repository has a license! Opendor.me is all about **open-source** contributions. Code without a license can be public but isn't open-source.
