No. There are not any plans to create or add a native messaging feature to the platform. Neither among users, nor for recruiting purposes.

No doubt, the opendor.me community may be a great place for recruiters to discover a new network of talented open-source developers. Yet, the main goal isn't to be a recruiting platform in a traditional sense.

Recruiters are welcome to join the community and - for users that opt-in - they will be able to find alternative contact methods on profiles.
