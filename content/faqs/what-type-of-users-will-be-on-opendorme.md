Our platform's primary user is an open-source **developer** and contributor to GitHub-hosted projects. They are a developer contributing to at least one open-source project looking to highlight their work. 

We also will provide **recruiters** with methods to discover open-source developers. We hope that our community will allow them to see who's working on projects their company uses or needs.

Similarly, for open-source **organizations** this community will connect them with potential contributors. So they will be able to discover and be discovered by talented developers in their field.
