Our goal is to help open-source contributors share and highlight their open-source work. We know how hard open-source work can be, but we also know how rewarding it can be.

This platform is being created and maintained by open-source developers as an open-source project after all. So we want to do our best to make the open-source work you do as rewarding and visible as possible.

We're creating a community for talented open-source developers to highlight their best work in an understandable way. We want to empower developers and maintainers to network and discover other projects.
